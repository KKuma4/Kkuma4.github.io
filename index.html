<h1> Natural Simulations </h1>
<p> 
  This module required me to combine my skills in JS, ProcessingJS and use various mathematical and physics concepts into applications of simulating nature. There was high usage of concepts such as vectors, noise and dynamics. This makes me pursue other STEM courses even more and put it in application through programming. Also, object-oriented programming is dominant here and made significant effects in terms of getting comfortable with it.
